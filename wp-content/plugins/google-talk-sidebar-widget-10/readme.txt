Adds WordPress sidebar widget to show Google chatback badge on the website and offer visitors web chat through Google Talk instant messaging network.

== Description ==

** Note to previous users of 1.0: ** This is essentially a new plugin. The old chat badge can be added to your sidebar by copy and pasting google's badge code into a normal text widget.

Using Google Talk, you can now simulate a professional live chat system on your website! This plugin allows further flexibility over Google Talk by allowing customizeable online/offline status badges, as well as wrapping the chat window in a smooth overlay effect, avoiding the need for ugly popups.

New features in 2.0:

* Multi-account fallback (when one goes offline, another available account will be used).
* Google Talk client is wrapped in a overlay widget.
* AJAX online status checking - visitors don't need to refresh the page when you come back online.
* Customizeable online and offline icons
* Customizeable link for offline clicks (e.g. your contact form)
* Template tag and shortcode available
* Online status caching for higher traffic volumes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q: Will the entire thing work with Google Apps for Domain

A: If you can create a badge here (http://www.google.com/talk/service/badge/New) then yes.

Q: Im testing… Need signup for gmail for use this plugin?

A: You don't need "gmail" but you do need a google account to receive messages from visitors. You don’t need as a visitor.

Q: Is this one with one chat or it can be many ppl inside one chat?

A: This instant messaging chat is one visitor and the one who hosts website (talkback badge owner). If there are 2+ visitors, the chat owner sees independent windows for every visitor, so vistors cant see each other.

Q: Is there any way for you to see who contacts you?

A: No, visitors are totally anonymous in the chat
